# Seattle-Crime
You can view my post on my blog here:

The Seattle Crime Data file reads the data into R and subsets the data into different vectors and lists so that one can easily make maps and graphs of the data using ggmaps, ggplot2, etc.

After running the original Crime Data file you can run the maps and graphs files. At least some of the code requires you to run some of the loops in the data file multiple times to create a vector / list to replicate the graphs I made in my blogpost. 

Please contact me if you have any suggestions or critiques of my code, as I am still learning!
